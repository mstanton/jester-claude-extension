## Security Architecture

Claude-Jester employs a multi-layered security architecture designed for enterprise environments:

### 🏰 Defense-in-Depth Strategy

```
Layer 1: Input Validation & Static Analysis
├── Pattern-based vulnerability detection
├── AST parsing for code analysis
├── Injection attack prevention
└── Compliance rule checking

Layer 2: Container Isolation (Podman)
├── Rootless container execution
├── Network isolation (--network none)
├── Read-only filesystem
├── Resource limits (memory, CPU, time)
├── User namespace separation
└── Capability dropping (--cap-drop ALL)

Layer 3: Runtime Monitoring
├── Real-time behavior analysis
├── Resource usage tracking
├── Anomaly detection
├── Process monitoring
└── File system access control

Layer 4: Audit & Compliance
├── Complete execution logging
├── Encrypted audit trails
├── SOC2/ISO27001 compliance
├── Enterprise reporting
└── Incident response procedures

Layer 5: Desktop Integration Security
├── OS-level credential storage
├── Encrypted configuration
├── Secure file handling
└── Process isolation
```
